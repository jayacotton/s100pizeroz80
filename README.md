# S100 Pi Zero Z80  Project.
A pi zero z80 emulator running on s100 bus 


This project is an attempt to create a z80 emulator running on s100 bus hardware.

A comment on fidelity.  We will not likely be able to produce exactly the I/O process
that the z80 does.  I'm thinking about the upper 8 address bits during the OTIR etc.
instructions.  This may have some side effects latter on.

I'll avoid hand waving at this time.
